Todo:

  - A new efficiency metric (APSP / Diameter)
    - Diameter = worst shortest path
  - New robustness metrics
    - Reliability polynomial
      - Edge removal
      - Node removal

By May 1:
  - Lab report
    - Start with GA explanation
    - Explain SECON paper
    - Discuss results
    - Discuss better metrics for efficiency and robustness
  - Submit nicely commented code (pretty much done, just update README with some more details)

Lab Report:
  - Redo for original SECON metrics
  - Conduct experiment for the new metrics
